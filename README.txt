This is a Tomboy Addin, to mess around with it, get the latest Tomboy
source from here http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/
(i used Tomboy 1.5.3 wihch was the current git-repo version).

When you have your Tomboy project set up, copy the projects from here
to Tomboy/Addins/ and add them to the solution. Now you should be ready
to play around with the code.
